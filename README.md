# corporate-design-doxygen

This repository holds all related files for building a doxygen documentation using the STACKFORCE corporate design.

Basically, unless you're heading to modify the design, there is no need to clone that repository. Cmake inside the other repositories will/should grab the latest version of the required files from this repository on their own, whenever they're building a documentation based on doxygen.
